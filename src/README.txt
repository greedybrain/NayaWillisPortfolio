As a Software Engineer with a strong focus on
Frontend development, my passion lies in crafting
engaging, user-centric web experiences. My expertise
extends across key technologies such as React,
Redux, NextJS, and TypeScript, enabling me to
develop dynamic, responsive, and maintainable web
interfaces. While my experience includes full-stack
capabilities, with competencies in Redis and Prisma
for backend support, my true enthusiasm is in the
frontend realm where I leverage my skills to bridge
the gap between technical possibilities and user
needs. My tenure at Twitter, now X, complemented my
commitment to innovation, teamwork, and staying at
the forefront of Frontend development trends.
